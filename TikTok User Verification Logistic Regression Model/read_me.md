TikTokâ€™s Operations Management is interested in how different variables are associated with whether a user is verified. Earlier, the data team observed that if a user is verified, they are much more likely to post opinions. Now, the data team has decided to explore how to predict verified status to help them understand how video characteristics relate to verified users. 
## About the Dataset
The fictional dataset, named "tiktok_dataset.csv," has been specifically created for this project in collaboration with TikTok under the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. It comprises 19,383 rows, with each row representing a TikTok video. The dataset contains 12 columns, providing essential information about the videos and their engagement metrics.
## Goal
The primary goal of this analysis is to provide TikTok's Operations Management with a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the verification status of users. By delving into the attributes of videos and their connection to user verification, the aim is to uncover insights that can drive strategic decision-making and content management.
## Methodology
We have been asked to conduct a logistic regression using verified status as the outcome variable, to this end, it will be necessary to:
- Determine the outliers in the variables and handle them
- Check the class balances and to use resampling techniques to create the balance
- Encode categorical variables
- Visualize model results through confusion matrix and classification report 
accounts.
## Significance
The results hold significance as they offer valuable insights that can guide TikTok's management in understanding the disparities between videos posted by verified and unverified accounts. This information can aid in strategic decision-making and content moderation efforts.
