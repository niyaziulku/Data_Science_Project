This data science project is a continuation of the airlines project that we began modeling with decision trees. We will use the same data, however this time we will train, tune, and evaluate a random forest model.
## About the Dataset
This activity uses a dataset called Invistico_Airline.csv. It represents the details of customer feedback for Invistico Airlines (airline name changed).  
The dataset contains: 129,880 rows and 23 columns of customer feedback, each row representing one customer’s responses. Note that responses were given on a 0 to 5 scale, 0 meaning “not at all satisfied” and 5 meaning “very satisfied.”
## Goal
The airline is interested in predicting whether a future customer would be satisfied with their services given previous customer feedback about their flight experience. The airline is interested in knowing which features are most important to customer satisfaction.
## Methodology
-	Exploring the data and completing the cleaning process
-	Building a random forest model
-	Tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
-	Evaluating a decision tree model using a confusion matrix and various other plots such as importance graph
## Significance
The significance of this project lies in its potential to provide Invistico Airlines with actionable insights into customer satisfaction dynamics. The model offers a predictive framework that can enhance the airline's understanding of which factors significantly influence customer contentment. This understanding can aid the airline in refining its services and making targeted improvements to enhance overall customer satisfaction.
