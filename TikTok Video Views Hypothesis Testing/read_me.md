This data science project aims to conduct hypothesis testing on the fictional TikTok user claim dataset to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the number of views for videos posted by verified accounts versus unverified accounts. The analysis will help understand the relationship between verified status and video view count.
## About the Dataset
The dataset, named tiktok_dataset.csv, contains synthetic data specifically created for this project within the framework of Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate in partnership with TikTok. It comprises 19,383 rows, with each row representing a TikTok video containing a claim or opinion. The dataset includes 12 columns, providing crucial information about the videos and their engagement metrics.
## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to determine whether there is a significant difference in video view counts between verified and unverified accounts on TikTok by applying descriptive and inferential statistics, probability distributions, and hypothesis testing.
## Methodology
To achieve our goal, we will follow these steps:
- Compute descriptive statistics on the claims classification data to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.
- Choose a significance level of 5% for the hypothesis test to determine statistical significance.
- Formulate null and alternative hypotheses to assess the relationship between verified status and video view count.
- Conduct a two-sample hypothesis test to compare the average video view counts between videos from verified and unverified accounts.
## Significance
The significance of this project lies in understanding potential behavioral differences between videos from verified and unverified accounts. Understanding the root cause of the behavioral difference can help TikTok develop strategies to improve user engagement and optimize content recommendations.
