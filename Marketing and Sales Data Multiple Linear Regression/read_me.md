# Marketing And Sales Data Linear Regression
![](https://www.feedough.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-marketing.png)

In this project, we will explore the relationship between marketing promotional budgets and sales by performing a complete simple linear regression analysis, which includes:
- Exploring and cleaning data
- Using plots and descriptive statistics to select the independent variables
- Creating a fitting multiple linear regression model which helps estimate the linear relationship between one continuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables
- Checking model assumptions
- Interpreting model outputs and communicating the results to non-technical stakeholders
## About the Dataset
The features in the data are:
- TV promotion budget (high-medium-low)
- Radio promotion budget (in millions of dollars)
- Social media promotion budget (in millions of dollars)
- Influencer- What type of influencer the promotion collaborated with (Mega > Macro > Micro > Nano)
- Sales (in millions of dollars)
Each row corresponds to an independent marketing promotion where their business uses TV, social media, radio, and influencer promotions to increase sales.
## Goal
The company previously had a work on finding a single variable that predicts sales, and now they are hoping to expand this analysis to include other variables that can help them target their marketing efforts.
## Methodology
To address the business' request, we will conduct a multiple linear regression analysis to estimate sales from a combination of independent variables by creating pairplot to find the relationship between dependent and independent variables, checking the assumptions of the specific models to be chosen and interpreting the results. 
## Significance
Based on this information, leaders in the company will make decisions about which combinations of promotion efforts to focus for future marketing efforts, so it is critical to have a clear understanding of the relationship between the different types of marketing and the revenue generated.
