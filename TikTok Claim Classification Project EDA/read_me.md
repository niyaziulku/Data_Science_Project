The fictional TikTok data team embarks on a machine learning project to classify user submissions as "claims" or "opinions." Before model building, the data undergoes thorough analysis, exploration, cleaning, and structuring.
## About the Dataset
The dataset, named tiktok_dataset.csv, contains synthetic data specifically created for this project within the framework of Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate in partnership with TikTok. It comprises 19,383 rows, with each row representing a TikTok video containing a claim or opinion. The dataset includes 12 columns, providing crucial information about the videos and their engagement metrics.
## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the TikTok dataset, ensuring a thorough understanding of the data's structure and characteristics. By analyzing variables related to user engagement, such as view, like, and comment counts, it is aimed to prepare the data for the subsequent classification model building phase.
## Methodology
The project involves extensive data structuring, cleaning, and visualization using Python. During the EDA stage, we focused on exploring the impact of different TikTok video qualities on user engagement. Notably, we examined the distribution of key variables, identified null values, and noted the imbalance in claim and opinion video counts to be taken into account while constructing the model.
## Significance
The exploratory data analysis yielded crucial insights for building an effective claim classification model. Understanding the distribution of data variables, the presence of null values, and the distribution imbalance will inform the model parameters and guide the selection of appropriate model types. By addressing these considerations, we can ensure the model's accuracy and effectiveness in classifying user submissions.
The visualization results provided in the project's Python notebook offer valuable visual representations of the data, enhancing the overall understanding of TikTok user engagement trends. The insights gained will serve as a foundation for further model building and contribute to the development of an efficient claim classification system for TikTok's data team.
Let's embark on this data-driven journey to unlock meaningful insights and develop a powerful claim classification model together!
