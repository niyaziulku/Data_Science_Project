# Marketing And Sales Data Linear Regression
![](https://www.fundoodata.com/learning-center/wp-content/uploads/article-images19.png)

In this project, we will explore the relationship between marketing promotional budgets and sales by performing a complete simple linear regression analysis, which includes 
- creating and fitting a model, 
- checking model assumptions, 
- analyzing model performance, 
- interpreting model coefficients, and 
- communicating results to stakeholders. 
## About the Dataset
The dataset provided includes information about marketing campaigns across TV, radio, and social media, as well as how much revenue in sales was generated from these campaigns.
The features in the data are:
- TV promotion budget (in millions of dollars)
- Social media promotion budget (in millions of dollars)
- Radio promotion budget (in millions of dollars)
- Sales (in millions of dollars)
Each row corresponds to an independent marketing promotion where the business invests in TV, Social Media, and Radio promotions to increase sales.
## Goal
The business would like to determine which feature most strongly predicts sales so they have a better understanding of what promotions they should invest in in the future.
## Methodology
To accomplish this, we will construct a simple linear regression model that predicts sales using a single independent variable.
To select the relevant independent variable, we will create a pairplot to visualize the relationships between pairs of variables in the data. We will use this to visually determine which variable has the strongest linear relationship with sales.
## Significance
Based on this information, leaders in the company will make decisions about where to focus future marketing efforts, so it is critical to have a clear understanding of the relationship between the different types of marketing and the revenue they generate.
